# Telecom Customer Churn

The goal of this project was to use a provided dataset along with a dataset I found on my own (I used one from the World Bank) to visualize data that would be useful to decision-makers at a telecom company. This was a 3 part part project consisting of building a dashboard in Tableau, building a presentation using Tableau's Story feature, and writing a paper.
