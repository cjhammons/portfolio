# Experience

## Boingo Wireless - Data Engineer

### Maintaining Event API

I am currently maintaining the company's primary ETL pipeline. This pipeline ingests raw events and loads them into our datalake in Snowflake. It also sends them to Datadog for log ingestion.

The ETL is written in Go, and is deployed via Docker container to a Kubernetes cluster. As of Summer 2023 this cluster is in AWS EKS, but it is being moved to GCP GKE. 

### Migration from AWS to GCP

The main directive for Boingo engineering for the year 2023 is to migrate all of our cloud infrastructure from AWS to GCP. This is a massive undertaking, as it involves learning what the GCP equivalents are for AWS services and then adapting existing AWS code to work with a GCP environment.

### Python ETLs in Jenkins

Designed and implemented ETL processes using Python to synchronize data between BambooHR and AdaptiveWork through our Snowflake data lake, enhancing the efficiency of Boingo's operations team.
