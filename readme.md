## Academic Data Science

I've had the opportunity to participate in multiple data-intensive projects while working on my Master's in Data Analytics.

### Predicting Patient Readmissions 
This series of projects used multiple classification and regression methods to predict the likelihood of a patient beind readmitted into a hospital within 30 days of initial release.

  - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/cjhammons/Logistic-Regression-on-Medical-Data)
  - [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/cjhammons/Knn-Classification)
  - [Decision Tree](https://github.com/cjhammons/Decision-Tree/tree)
  - [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/cjhammons/Multiple-Linear-Regression-on-Medical-Data):

### Telecom Customer Churn
The goal of this project was to use a provided dataset along with a dataset I found on my own (I used one from the World Bank) to visualize data that would be useful to decision-makers at a telecom company. This was a 3 part part project consisting of building a dashboard in Tableau, building a presentation using Tableau's Story feature, and writing a paper.

- [Paper](https://github.com/cjhammons/portfolio/blob/master/projects/telecom-project/reflection-paper.pdf)
